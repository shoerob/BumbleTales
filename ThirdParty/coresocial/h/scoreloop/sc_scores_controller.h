 * @brief  Retrieves lists of score objects from the server.
 *
 * @addtogroup  SC_ScoresController
 * @{
 *
 * Instances of \ref SC_ScoresController retrieve lists of scores from the server.
 *
 * Basic use:
 * -# Get an instance of \ref SC_Client.
 * -# Use the client instance to call SC_Client_CreateScoresController().
 * -# Search criteria can be set as follows:
 *    Specify the search list for the controller by calling SC_ScoresController_SetSearchList().
 *    You can specify the following search lists: SC_SCORE_SEARCH_LIST_GLOBAL,
 *    SC_SCORE_SEARCH_LIST_24H, or SC_SCORE_SEARCH_LIST_USER_COUNTRY.
 * -# Set the mode for the controller by calling SC_ScoresController_SetMode().
 * -# Request the scores by using one of the following loadScores methods:
 *    - SC_ScoresController_LoadScores()
 *    - SC_ScoresController_LoadScoresAroundScore()
 *    - SC_ScoresController_LoadScoresAroundUser()
 * -# Wait for a successful server response via delegate callbacks.
 * -# Once the request is complete, access the scores that were returned by calling SC_ScoresController_GetScores().
 *
 * To page through additional scores:
 * -# Call SC_ScoresController_HasNextRange() and SC_ScoresController_HasPreviousRange() to determine if it is possible to page.
 * -# Use SC_ScoresController_LoadNextRange() or SC_ScoresController_LoadPreviousRange() to request the next or previous list of scores from
 * the server.
 * -# After a successful server response, access the SC_Scores_list that was returned, by calling SC_ScoresController_GetScores().
