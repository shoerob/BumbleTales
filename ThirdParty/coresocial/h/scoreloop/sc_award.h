/**
 * \brief   Models an award that is available in a game application.
 *
 * @file        sc_award.h
 * @addtogroup  SC_Award
 * @{
 * The \ref SC_Award class models an award that is available in a game application.
 * You must configure awards on the Scoreloop developer website at
 * https://developer.scoreloop.com , where you can specify or edit
 * each of the individual properties for the following class.
 *
 * Note that instances of Award are not created directly,
 * but rather are specified declaratively in the Scoreloop-generated awards bundle.
 *
 * Once an award is configured on the website, Scoreloop
 * generates an awards bundle, which unzipped must be added to the game project.
 * The awards bundle provides local access to the individual properties like:
 * - The identifier
 * - The initial value of the award (which is any number)
 * - The achieving value of the award (which is any number, greater or equal to initial value)
 * - The reward
 * - The title and description
 * - The image names for both states (unachieved and achieved)
 *
 * Awards are static. You can only query the information defined in an award bundle.
 * Then build a screen based on them. Something that makes them alive are achievements.
 * Achievement describes if and when user gained an award.
 *
 * Users unlock an award by meeting a certain value that is set inside the bundle.
 * This is defined as the achieving value for the award. You can configure awards
 * so that this value can be reached in incremental stages, if desired.
 * The number of incremental stages is defined by subtraction:
 * SC_Award_GetAchievingValue() - SC_Award_GetInitialValue().
 *
 * For example, you might configure an award that has the following properties:
 * - Initial value: 0, that is, the starting value.
 * - Achieving value: 10,
 * - Then the expected progress tracked by an achievement must fall into range: (0,10),
 * that gives 10 incremental stages.
 *
 * When the game is played, this might mean that the user
 * must collect 10 secret jewels in order to unlock the award.
 * Before the user finds the first jewel the following is true:
 * - Initial value = 0.
 *
 * With each jewel found, the value could be increases by 1. When the
 * number of jewels found equals the achieving value then the current user achieves the award.
 *
 * To actually be able to invoke it from inside the game, you use the award identifiers.
 * It is the reverse DNS style name, that could be used against an AchievementsController
 * to localize the proper object and invoke and increment on it.
 *
 * The Achievement class is used to manage the incremental increases
 * in value and to keep track of whether or not an award has been achieved.
 *
 * See \ref SC_Achievement and \ref SC_AchievementsController for the correct use.
