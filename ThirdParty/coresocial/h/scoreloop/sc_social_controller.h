 * Basic use:
 * -# Use the client instance to get an instance of \ref SC_SocialController by calling SC_Client_CreateSocialController().
 *    Specify the social network that you want to connect to as an argument to SC_Client_CreateSocialController(). Currently, Facebook and Twitter are supported.
 *    The identifiers are the following: SC_SOCIAL_FACEBOOK, SC_SOCIAL_TWITTER).
 * -# Check whether the user is already connected to the social network by calling SC_SocialController_IsConnectedToSocialNetwork().
 * -# If the user is not connected, connect to the social network by calling SC_SocialController_ConnectToSocialNetwork().

 * network and grants the necessary permissions to the Scoreloop application (if applicable).
 * When this phase is complete, the callback is issued with the SC_SOCIAL_AUTHORIZATION_FINISHED event.
 *
 * The second phase is triggered only if the first phase finished successfully, that is, the
 * callback method is called and returns SC_OK as the completionStatus. Otherwise, no further
 * processing is performed the and controller becomes idle.
 *
 * During the second phase, the web browser window is closed and the controller updates the user
 * status on the Scoreloop servers. When this stage is complete, the callback method is called and returns SC_SOCIAL_CONNECTING_FINISHED.
