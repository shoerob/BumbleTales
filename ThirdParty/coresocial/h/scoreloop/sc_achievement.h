/**
 * @brief       Models whether an SC_Award is achieved by a user or not.
 * @file        sc_achievement.h
 * @addtogroup  SC_Achievement
 * @{
 *
 * The Achievement class models whether or not an \ref SC_Award has been achieved by a user.
 * It also contains information about progress if the award can not be granted in a single step,
 * its date and the image, which reflects the current state.
 *
 * You query this state by checking the boolean value returned by SC_Achievement_IsAchieved().
 * - If the boolean value equals SC_TRUE, then the award has been achieved by the user.
 * - If the boolean value equals SC_FALSE, then the award has not been achieved by the user.
 *
 * To achieve an award, a user must reach an arbitrary value that you set,
 * this is 1 in most cases. You can configure the "achieving value" so it can be reached in stages.
 * You must configure both the "achieving value" of the award and the number of stages that it takes to reach it
 * at https://developer.scoreloop.com.
 *
 * For example, you might configure an award so that the "achieving value" equals 10,
 * and that this can be reached in 10 separate incremental stages.
 * When the game is played, this might mean that the user could achieve the award
 * by collecting 10 secret jewels - finding a single jewel would represent completing
 * one of the configured incremental stages. After the tenth jewel has been found then
 * the user has reached the configured "achieving value" and achieves the award.
 *
 * The progress however is stored only locally on the device.
 * Just the information about achieved awards is synchronized with the server.
 *
 * Achievement objects are retrieved from the server by using an AchievementsController.
